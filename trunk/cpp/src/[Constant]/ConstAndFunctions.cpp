/*
 * The use of const to specify function arguments and return values is another
 * place where the concept of constants can be confusing. If you are passing
 * objects by value, specifying const has no meaning to the client (it means
 * that the passed argument cannot be modified inside the function). If you
 * are returning an object of a user-defined type by value as a const, it
 * means the returned value cannot be modified. If you are passing and
 * returning addresses, const is a promise that the destination of the address
 * will not be changed.

//The formal parameter i is declared const so it can not be modified inside
//the function.
//Since the parameter i is passed by value, the original variable passed could
//never be modified by function f1 and so specifying const in function signature
//is useful only for the function creator, not for the function caller.
//By this signature, the function creator keep in mind that he don't want to
//manipulate in any way the value passed.

//In fact with this definition you say that a functionâ€™s return value is const.
//you are promising that the original variable (inside the function frame) will not

//you are returning a result by value and so the function inside the function is
//copied.
