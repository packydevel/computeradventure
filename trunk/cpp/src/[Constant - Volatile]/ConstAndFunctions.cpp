/*
 * The use of const to specify function arguments and return values is another
 * place where the concept of constants can be confusing. If you are passing
 * objects by value, specifying const has no meaning to the client (it means
 * that the passed argument cannot be modified inside the function). If you
 * are returning an object of a user-defined type by value as a const, it
 * means the returned value cannot be modified. If you are passing and
 * returning addresses, const is a promise that the destination of the address
 * will not be changed.
